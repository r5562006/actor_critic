# Actor-Critic Project

This project demonstrates the use of the Actor-Critic algorithm for reinforcement learning. The script trains an Actor-Critic model on the CartPole-v1 environment and prints the score for each episode.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `gym`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/actor_critic_project.git
    cd actor_critic_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to train the Actor-Critic model:
```sh
python actor_critic.py
